A few functions automating analysis reports creation. Work well in conjunction with `ettools` package. In particular, `prepare_named_report` understands and relies on file naming schemas used in that package (see the package README for more details). `save_report` is left there for backwards compatibility and is not used actively anymore.

The directories used by the function can be specified in the call; by default, the functions assume that the global environment contains a list called `dirs` with the information about the project directory structure. It assumes that `dirs$reports` contains the path to the project reports folder; further folders are assumed to be inside it, as can be seen in the default values for directory related parameters in the function definition.
